'' exactly what facilities did i use the toilet i was under the impression that that was covered in the regular hotel fee we got no complimentary coffee . no hair dryer in our room . no complimentary breakfast in the lobby either . so what did my facility fee cover that was never explained . the only thing we `` used '' was the bed bathroom and tv which comes with any hotel room and should be included in the price of the hotel . those should n't be considered as `` extras '' or `` facility fees . '' moreover expedia advertises this scummy hotel as having free wifi . hmmm . so if that 's part of the facility fee then it 's not free i 've been to ny lots of times . no hotel has ever charged this ridiculous fee it 's like you charged me twice for the same room . the only reason i picked this hotel was because with the pride festivities going on everything was booked or the prices were higher than usual . this hotel was advertised as 101/night on expedia . my brother paid for me and his daughter my niece to stay there for 2-nights . the price was 268 total . that should 've covered everything that comes with the hotel\",\n",

'' exactly what facilities did i use the toilet i was under the impression that that was covered in the regular hotel fee we got no complimentary coffee . no hair dryer in our room . no complimentary breakfast in the lobby either . so what did my facility fee cover that was never explained . the only thing we `` used '' was the bed bathroom and tv which comes with any hotel room and should be included in the price of the hotel . those should n't be considered as `` extras '' or `` facility fees . '' moreover expedia advertises this scummy hotel as having free wifi . hmmm . so if that 's part of the facility fee then it 's not free i 've been to ny lots of times . no hotel has ever charged this ridiculous fee it 's like you charged me twice for the same room . the only reason i picked this hotel was because with the pride festivities going on everything was booked or the prices were higher than usual . this hotel was advertised as 101/night on expedia . my brother paid for me and his daughter my niece to stay there for 2-nights . the price was 268 total . that should 've covered everything that comes with the hotel\",\n",

       " \"the front lobby is very nice clean inviting and new . the pool area is great for kids and the outdoor bar was nice with great staff . our room was just okay ... bottom floor and needed updating badly . our tub was clogged and eventually fixed after the third day and asking twice for it to be fixed . i do n't understand how the staff that was cleaning the room would not see this as an issue . all in all it was okay for the price but think i would choose a different location if returning .\",\n",
       " 'the hotel is just 2/3 blocks from time square . you can feel safe since there is a police station next door . the hotel is well maintained and there is a parking by a fee a few steps from the entrance . i will strong recommend this hotel to everyone and especially to a family of 6. we were six people and we fit great inside the room we booked . we didn ’ t have breakfast at hotel so i can not rate the breakfast/restaurant and the related service . there are so many places around to try for different breakfast/meals every day . so we didn ’ t have chance to eat at hotel restaurant .',\n",
       " 'elevator stopped twice . staff knew about problem elevator.if my wife was stuck in elevator she would have freaked out . no shampoo tissue dispenser had 2 tissues.staff very nice .',\n",

       " 'check in was slow and they couldnt seem to find our reservation . it was loud around the pool after 10pm when we had to get some rest for an early flight . a lot of allergens in our room . staff seemed nice . wont stay here again .',\n",
       " 'had a very pleasant stay . have stayed before and like this hotel due to location good security and the restaurant attached . “ tick tock ” is 24/7 and does some really nice meals for those times when you just want to eat local for breakfast or any other time . i did not use bar or sports facilities . internet was good and international phone calls are free as part of the additional resort charges . staff were helpful and there is a good left luggage service for the day you leave . 5 dollars per bag and then you free to do a further explore . we left bags and then went to central park for a few hours until departure time . we had a room that was billed as 2 double beds . there was 3 of us and taking this room option over 2 separate rooms saved us about £1000 which is a big chunk of spending money . only real downside was the mattress sagged towards the middle . i imagine the rooms are used as upgraded twins the majority of the time . this meant you gravitated to the centre . as a single it was fine but struggled as a double . shower coffee making facilities fridge and so on in the room were fine . cleanliness very good . so apart from a slightly saggy mattress this hotel ticked all the boxes for us . would recommend for any family group or lads away weekend . great irish bar across street and round corner “ jack doyles ” 35th .... and pig whistle on next street 36th . but there is no shortage of bars and restaurants anywhere in ny . the new yorker on 8th avenue however is an iconic hotel .',\n",

       " \"the new yorker hotel is located in an ideal area in midtown manhattan . the quality of the rooms very much depends on what floor you 're on . my first room was not impressive at all with paint peeling of the walls in the bathroom . i requested a room change which was granted and the new room was a bit more modern but had no storage for clothing . the worst part of my stay at the new yorker hotel was the non negotiable fee they charge you for wifi and phone . they charge after taxes almost 40 a night in addition to your regular bill . other similar hotels charge similar fees but give you food and entertainment vouchers that can help balance things out . there are definitely better options in the city but in a pinch this hotel does offer comfortable beds in a convenient location .\",\n",
       " \"the locations and price was awesome . unfortunately many of the staff outside of the front desk spoke no english and i was hopelessly lost and needing help . the property is worn not unclean just in need of update . guest rooms definitely looking a little worse for wear . the fuests stayi g were loud and shouting curse words outside of my window at all hours which is not a fault of the hotel persay but things could be done to curb such behaviors . overall it was an ok experience . by far not the worst or best i 've had . id stay again only if i did n't have other options .\",\n",
       " \"great location away from the hustle but easy access to all things good subway stop restaurants on 9th centrally located . only bummer was our room smelled like urine soundproofing is less than ideal and the bar/restaurant could use some updating . the `` city view '' upgrade was not worth it .\",\n",

       " 'overall our stay was ok. the hotel is old but the pool and hot tub was pleasing . lots of space and couches in the lobby as we had to wait several hours for check-in . i was very disappointed when i saw one of the night staff at the front/check-in desk flossing his teeth . it was disgusting .',\n",

       " \"check in was a big fail - a sign of things to come . we had specifically booked a `` deluxe king room with balcony '' which in the expedia description specifies it has a bathtub/shower combination . first the guy at reception tries to upsell us on an upgraded room that has no balcony but does have a set of bunk beds in the room - why on earth would a couple want to pay more to have less ie no balcony and why would we want to pay more to have a set of bunk beds that we are not going to use when we got to our room and realised there was no bathtub even though we had verified it with the receptionist we called the guest services line and an unenthusiastic voice told us to come back down and tell reception . no 'sorry about that ' or 'we will be glad to help you ' . the second receptionist guy basically said the expedia descriptor was false - they do n't have any rooms like that - and blamed his reservation colleagues saying there was nothing he could do . and on it went ... this hotel nickel and dimes you for everything - even when things do n't cost you money they cost you in stress and make it difficult for you to just enjoy and relax . for example nice pool area but why do you treat hotel guests as towel-stealing criminals before they have even entered the pool you have to sign out your towels - number of towels room and name - and god forbid you do n't return one they will hunt you down staff are not happy tables left dirty too long and service at bars/pool is slooooooow .\",\n",
